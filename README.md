# Kratos : A miniature x86 Operating System
Description
-------------------------------------------------------

Kratos was built as a miniature x86 based Operating System
to study Systems Programming on the popular x86 architecture.
The original v1.0 fork was started as a college project, and
subsequent development has been much lazy.
However v2.0 boots up the system into Protected-mode, and
will ease development and usage by manifold times, once a
C-startup is written. I'm thankful to my college friends, my
teammates for helping me start this ambitious project.
I'm looking forward to continue development on this project,
although I'm slightly occupied for now.

Kratos provides a very primitive shell which supports Keyboard
I/O, whitespace-handling and basic commands operating on VGA
card. More functionality will be added in later releases on
the newer 32-bit system.

Usage
-------------------------------------------------------

To build Kratos, please adjust the PATH variables and include
file paths. It'll build as a Standard 1.44Mb Floppy Image
(Kratos.IMA) and also, as a CD-Image (Kratos.ISO).
You can then run these files on Virtualization Software, or
burn them to original media and try Kratos out.
Have fun! :)
